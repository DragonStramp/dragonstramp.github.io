        <h3>Some Things?</h3>
        <p>I guess what I'm known for is 'programming' but that can be pretty broad. I make websites, games, bots, lot's of stuff. Essentially anything creative that doesn't require being artisticly talented</p>

        <h3>Hold up. Games?</h3>
        <p>Yeah I've made quite a few games over the past 6 or so years I've been doing it, only a few have been commercially released but most have been published, if you're curious. check out the games page for more info.</p>

        <h3>Why a videos page?</h3>
        <p>Since I was a kid I've been producing videos, meaning that I have an <i>incredibly</i> large backlog of content. Meaning that, because I had to be, I am good using photoshop, premiere, and pretty much anything you would need to produce and publish video.</p>

        <h3>Bots? What?</h3>
        <p>I've made a few discord bots just playing around with my friends, but they are unfortunately pretty impressive, from AI generating speech to talk to you, to relentless insults, I've made some... interesting... stuff.</p>
