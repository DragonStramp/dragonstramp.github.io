          <h3>The Fire</h3>
          <p>This is my first commercially released game, it's a difficult platforming game where the world grows around you. It is currently in Early Access.</p>

          <h3>Square Scramble</h3>
          <p>This was one of the first games I developed, it's a multiplayer fighting game where you have to knock your opponent off the edge of the map.</p>
