                <h1>A fighting game where you can't stop jumping</h1>
                <h3>kind of a retrospective</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>So there's a game called Square Scramble...</p>
                <p> it's on Gamejolt right now and it's one of my favorite projects I've ever worked on.</p>
                <p>It's kind of a weird story though.  Because Square Scramble wasn't really supposed to be a game when I first started working on it.</p>
                <p>It started off as a simulation of sorts where these cubes would just bounce around and you could put bets on which square you thought would stay on screen the longest. Then I ended up adding controls to it so you can move left and right.  And then it just kind of spiraled from there.</p>
                <p>Now it's got all sorts of content like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>around 15 maps, I can't really remember exactly how many</li>
                    <li>a bunch of player skins (which I'll talk about in a second)</li>
                    <li>random events that happen while you play</li>
                    <li>two other modes, one where you do platforming and one with a whole boss battle system</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h2>the maps</h2>
                <p>There's a map for every color of the rainbow! each with special mechanics in them like moving platforms, falling objects, and even AI enemies!</p>

                    <img src="blog-images/square-scramble-maps.png" alt="map select screen for square scramble">
                </div>
                <h3>The map select screen (14 maps btw)</h3>
                <p>I won't go over everything in each level but there's some really fun mechanics!</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>the skins</h2>
                <p>So one of the things that made me really like this game is I actually opened up the skin creation to the community during the development of the game.</p>
                <div class="blog-inner-image">
                    <img src="blog-images/square-scramble-skins.png" alt="map select screen for square scramble">
                </div>
                <h3>The skin selection screen</h3>
                <p>I can't show them all sadly but players were able to make and submit skins to me and I would put them in the game.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>conclusion</h2>
                <p>that's all I really have to say about it, it's free on gamejolt if you wanna play it but yeah thanks for reading!</p>
